Some dream
===
This is a very personal project. In the 90's late years, I loved to play MUD's online and create RPG rules and systems - and the possibility 
in the future to create a kind of this game is my principal inspiration to one day become a profissional developer.

After a lot of years in the industry and in quarantine it is time to make it happens (finally)

This RPG system and the game design are building from scratch - and in a hacking and experimental way - no professional "good practices" at all.

## Manifest

- I will avoid to use fancy libs to do the job, I will try to keep free from dependencies and abstractions
- I will apply classic render and interation techniques from zero for studying and 4science
- For now, I am using type annotation to every variable binding - it is more verbose but it's ok. Other little things like `String::from` instead `to_string` are in use.
- Doing the job first. Separation of concerns, tests and other kind of things later. 
- The main target is to have fun at all
