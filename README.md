Some dream
===
This is a very personal project. In the 90's late years, I loved to play MUD's online and create RPG rules and systems - and the possibility 
in the future to create a kind of this game is my principal inspiration to one day become a profissional developer.

After a lot of years in the industry and in quarantine it is time to make it happens (finally)

This RPG system and the game design are building from scratch - and in a hacking and experimental way - no professional "good practices" at all.

## How to run
